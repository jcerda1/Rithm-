Part I
Write down what the following statements will return. Try to figure this out before putting the commands in the chrome console.

2 == "2";      true
2 === 2;       true 
10 % 3;        1 
10 % 3 === 1;  true
true && false; false 
false || true; true 
true || false; true 



Part II
Answer the following questions about this code block:

var isLearning = true;
if(isLearning){
    console.log("Keep it up!");
} else {
    console.log("Pretty sure you are learning....");
}
What should the above code console.log?

console will read “Keep it up!” 

Why do we not need to specify if(isLearning === true)? Why does if(isLearning) work on its own?
  isLearning is type coerced into a boolean that equates to true. Since isLearning is        defined its value is changed to true;

var firstVariable;
var secondVariable = "";
var thirdVariable = 1;
var secretMessage = "Shh!";

if(firstVariable){
    console.log("first");
} else if(firstVariable || secondVariable){
    console.log("second");
} else if(firstVariable || thirdVariable){
    console.log("third");
} else {
    console.log("fourth");
}
What should the above code console.log? Why?
  It should log ‘third’ because first  and second are not defined and return a falsey.  These two values are undefined therefore the third condition is the first that returns a truthy value and will log the statement ‘third’. 

What is the value of firstVariable when it is initialized?
  undefined
Is the value of firstVariable a "truthy" value? Why?
  It is a falsey since it is undefined. 
Is the value of secondVariable a "truthy" value? Why?
  No this is also a falsey as it is also undefined.
Is the value of thirdVariable a "truthy" value? Why?
  Yes this is the first value that is a truthy. 1 is type coerced to the boolean true.


Part III
Research Math.random here and write an if statement that console.log's "Over 0.5" if Math.random returns a number greater than 0.5. Otherwise console.log "Under 0.5".

var random = Math.random();

if(random > 0.5) {
    console.log('Over 0.5');
  } else {
    console.log("Under 0.5");
}
                
   
What is a falsey value? List all the falsey values in JavaScript.
 
 A falsey is 1 of 6 values in Javascript that is equal to false. The six values are:
0,””, null, undefined, false, NaN
